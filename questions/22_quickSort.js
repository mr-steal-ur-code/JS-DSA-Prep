/*22. Quick Sort
Implement the quick sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer
algorithm that selects a pivot element, partitions the array into elements less than and greater than the
pivot, and recursively applies the same procedure to the subarrays.

Input: [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]
Output: [1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]
