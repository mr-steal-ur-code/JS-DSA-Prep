/*21. Insertion Sort
Write a function to perform insertion sort on an array of integers. Insertion sort works by dividing the
array into a sorted and an unsorted part. It repeatedly takes the first element of the unsorted part and
inserts it into the correct position in the sorted part.

Input: [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
Output: [5, 6, 11, 12, 13]

const insertionSort = (arr) => {

}
console.log(insertionSort([12, 11, 13, 5, 6]));
