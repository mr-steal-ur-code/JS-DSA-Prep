/*20. Bubble Sort
Implement the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. Bubble sort is a
simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps
them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Input: array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
*/

const bubbleSort = (arr) => {

}
console.log(bubbleSort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]));
