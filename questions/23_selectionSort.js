/*23. Selection Sort
Create a function to sort an array of integers using selection sort. Selection sort works by repeatedly
finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and swapping it with the first unsorted element.

Input: array = [29, 10, 14, 37, 13]
Output: [10, 13, 14, 29, 37]
*/

const selectionSort = (arr) => {

}
console.log(selectionSort([29, 10, 14, 37, 13]));
